I think we can do similar thing for this files also
ON
- frontend\app\[locale]\(home)\dashboard\page.tsx from line 466 - 597
- frontend\app\[locale]\(home)\land\page.tsx from line 375 -506
- frontend\app\[locale]\(home)\land\rs-numbers\page.tsx from line 330 -481

All are creating same RS Number

And ON
- frontend\app\[locale]\(home)\land\rs-numbers\[id]\page.tsx from line 504 to 646
Edit that RS Number
we can create a reuseable component for that functionality and use that on this 4 place and can reduce 1000 lines of code




Need to go modal base solution for this routes
- frontend\app\[locale]\(home)\cancellations\new\page.tsx       => OK

- frontend\app\[locale]\(home)\employees\new\page.tsx           => OK
- frontend\app\[locale]\(home)\employees\edit\[id]\page.tsx     => OK

- frontend\app\[locale]\(home)\expenses\categories\new\page.tsx => OK

- frontend\app\[locale]\(home)\expenses\new\page.tsx            => OK

- frontend\app\[locale]\(home)\receipts\new\page.tsx            => OK

- frontend\app\[locale]\(home)\sales\new\page.tsx

You were right - I also need some pages in there like
/banking/bank-accounts
/banking/bank-accounts/[account_id]

also
/banking/cash-accounts
/banking/cash-accounts/[account_id]

Can we merge them and just create
/banking/[accounts_type]
/banking/[accounts_type]/[account_id]


also we need a page for 
/banking/cheques and maybe its cascading




Ok that part is working fine thanks. Now I have a route /sms
frontend\app\[locale]\(home)\sms\page.tsx
Now I have some missing feature here
1. I have /sms/templates but it has no route in ui
2. See a template details is missing
3. Create and edit a new sms template is also missing (Go for modal based solution - see this for a ref frontend\components\employees\employee-form-modal.tsx)
